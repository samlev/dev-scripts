Dev Scripts
===========

Some basic scripts for making life easier when working on multiple projects with Laravel sail.

## Assumptions

The assumptions made in these svriots are:

* You use `phpstorm` as your IDE.
* You have multiple Laravel sail powered projects somewhere in your home directory.
* You have the [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) terminal emulator installed.
* You have zenity installed.

If you're not me, use these at your own risk.

If you _are_ me, also use these at your own risk, but know that you should know better.

Please don't ask me for support, or tell me that I'm doing things wrong. Tjis works for me, and that's enough.
